      <description>Prereqs Follow the guide here and install WSL. I chose Ubuntu 18.04 because it&amp;rsquo;s got access to a large and well-curated package library and there are plentiful answers to problesm with it. It also seems to be the &amp;ldquo;default&amp;rdquo; distro that most people install on WSL and so instructions for getting tricky things working on WSL usually assume you&amp;rsquo;re using Ubuntu.
Terminology This guide will refer to running/installing things on Windows as well as referring to installing things in the Ubuntu Linux guest system that was installed via the Windows Subsystem for Linux.</description>
