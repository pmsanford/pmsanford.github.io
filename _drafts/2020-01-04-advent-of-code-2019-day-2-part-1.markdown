The Problem
-----------
Ok, we're into the interesting stuff now. The problem for this one is to build a [virtual machine][https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_virtual_machine] for an elfen computer architecture called Intcode. This is exciting for me, because I've been interested in these kinds of toy architectures [for a while][https://github.com/pmsanford/sic-debug]. The first part of this article is going to be a slightly expanded rehash of the description in [the problem description][https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/2] on the AoC website.

We're going to simulate an extremely simple computer. Here's an extremely simplified description of how processors execute a program:

1. Start by reading a number (called an __opcode__) at a specific location in memory. This is called the __entry point__.
2. Based on this number, perform a single operation. This might involve:
  a. Loading one or more __arguments__ from the memory location(s) following the instruction.
  b. Storing the result of the operation
3. Advance the __instruction pointer__ by a certain amount. In the current exercise, the instruction pointer is always advanced by __4__ - we'll see why in a moment.
4. Unless the opcode says otherwise, start again at step 1, except instead of the __entry point__, read an __opcode__ from the location referred to by the __instruction pointer__.

The operations our Intcode computer is expected to perform (and the numbers they're represented by) are:

|Opcode|Operation|Description                   | Arguments                                                                        |
|------|---------|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|     1|      ADD| Add two numbers together     | 3: The memory locations of two numbers to add plus a location to store the result|
|     2|      MUL| Multiply two numbers together| 3: Same as above, but to multiply                                                |
|    99|     HALT| Stop processing instructions | 0: Just stop                                                                     |

The initial state of memory will be represented by a comma-separated list of numbers we'll read off the hard drive. Our __entry point__ will always be the first memory location. As in most programming languages, the first memory location is position __0__. In this and the following articles about the Intcode computer, I'll be referring to a memory location with a number in square brackets. So memory location 0 will look like this: __[0]__

So, let's take a look at the example program from Advent of Code (here broken into individual instructions): 

`1,9,10,3`
`2,3,11,0`
`99`
`30,40,50`

You might notice that there are numbers in memory following the `HALT` instruction - since this computer (like the computer on which you're reading this) doesn't segregate executable instructions from data, any data upon which you want to operate shares space with the processor instructions. This last triplet is just data.

The first instruction is broken down like this:

`1`: This is the opcode for ADD.

`9`: This is the __location of__ the first number we'll be adding. Since the first memory location is 0, this address refers to the 10th number in the list. If we count up, we find this is `30`, the number immediately following the `HALT` instruction in the full program.

`10`: This is the location of the second number, which is `40` (immediately following the previous number).

`3`: This is another location: The location to store the result. Notice that this is the 4th part of this instruction. We started this instruction at 0, so this memory location actually refers to itself.

So then, when our VM encounters this instruction, it should add __[9]__ (which contains the number 30) to __[10]__ (which contains the number 40) and store the result at __[3]__. After executing the first instruction, the memory should look like this:

`1,9,10,70`
`2,3,11,0`
`99`
`30,40,50`

The next instruction at __[4]__ is a multiply instruction, __[3]__ * __[11]__ stored at __[0]__ (which means it's overwriting the opcode from the previous instruction. After that we move the instruction pointer up 4 again, to __[8]__ which contains the `HALT` instruction. The final state of memory is:

`3500,9,10,70`
`2,3,11,0`
`99`
`30,40,50`

The Solution
------------

Before we get into writing the VM, let's look at a few more Fortran features we haven't seen yet.

Arrays
======

One of Fortran's fortes (heh) is array handling. This is often cited as one of the reasons it has survived so long in the scientific and academic community. Some of its features, like robust slicing, are surprisingly sophisticated. Arrays are declared and used like this:

```fortran
integer :: arr_one(6) ! a one-dimensional array of length six. One-indexed.
integer :: arr_two(2, 3) ! a two-dimensional array, two 3-element arrays
integer :: arr_three(0:5) ! a one-dimensional array of length six, zero-indexed.
integer :: arr_four(-2:3) ! yep. a one-dimensional array of length six, negative two indexed.

arr_one(1) = 5 ! Set the first element to 5 (yes, they're 1-indexed)
arr_one(0) = 1 ! Probably cause a segmentation fault when this array is deallocated

arr_one(4:6) = arr_one(1:3) ! set the values at indicies 4-6 to the values from 1-3

arr_one = 3 ! Set every element to 3
arr_one = (/1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6/) ! Initialize every element at once

arr_two(1, 1) = 5 ! Set the first element of the first array to 5
arr_two = reshape((/1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6/), shape(arr_two)) ! Initialize all arrays

arr_three(0) = 5 ! Set the first element to 5 (yes, you can set the indexing)

arr_four(-2) = 5 ! Set the first element to 5 (I know right)
```


Allocation
==========

Fortran has two ways to use heap memory. Pointers, which we'll see later, and "allocatable" variables. Other than being allocated on the heap, they work just like regular versions of those variables. You declare them like this:

```fortran
integer, allocatable :: arr_one(:) ! Specify a colon for the array's size
character(len=:), allocatable :: str_one ! Specify a colon for the string's length

allocate(arr_one(5))
allocate(character(len=4) :: str_one)
```

Allocatable variables are automatically deallocated when they go out of scope. They are also guaranteed to be contiguous in memory (unlike memory allocated to pointers) which makes it more efficient to pass them around. The only downside is they can't alias existing memory. You also have to know the rank (number of dimensions) up front (but this is also true for pointers).
