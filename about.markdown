I lived in Florida for 29 years, first Pensacola and then Jacksonville. I moved to Mountain View and then San Francisco afterwards. I enjoy taking photos, but my interest in it ebbs and flows. I collect hobbies that wash in and out of my life like the tides. If I can manage to keep this one on land, hopefully you can read about the rest of them here.
